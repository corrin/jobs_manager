- Follow NZ Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 requirements
- Apply the hierarchy of controls (Elimination > Substitution > Engineering > Administrative > PPE)
- Focus on practical, implementable control measures
- Consider the metal fabrication and installation context

- Working at heights, with heavy equipment, near traffic
- Hot work (welding, grinding) in variable environments
- Manual handling of heavy fabricated items

Risk ratings:
- Low: Minor injury unlikely, proceed with standard precautions
- Moderate: Injury possible, additional controls recommended
- High: Serious injury likely without controls, must implement controls
- Extreme: Life-threatening, do not proceed without comprehensive controls and approval
