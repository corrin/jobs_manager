# Product Context: Jobs Manager

## Purpose
The "Jobs Manager" project appears to be a comprehensive web application designed to streamline and manage various aspects of a business's operations, particularly those related to jobs, timesheets, quoting, and client accounts.

## Problems Solved
- **Job Tracking:** Centralized system for managing job details, progress, and related files.
- **Timesheet Management:** Facilitates recording and tracking employee work hours.
- **Quoting:** Supports the creation and management of quotes for clients.
- **Client & Staff Accounts:** Manages user accounts for both clients and internal staff.
- **Reporting:** Likely provides insights into job status, financial performance, and staff utilization.
- **Material Management:** Appears to handle material entries and adjustments related to jobs.

## How it Should Work (Assumed User Flows)
1. **Job Creation & Management:** Users (likely staff) can create new jobs, assign them to staff, update their status, add materials, and attach files.
2. **Timesheet Submission:** Staff can log their hours against specific jobs or tasks.
3. **Quoting Process:** Sales or administrative staff can generate quotes, link them to jobs, and manage their approval status.
4. **Reporting:** Managers or administrators can generate various reports (e.g., job progress, financial summaries, timesheet audits).
5. **User Authentication:** Secure login for different user roles (staff, clients).

## User Experience Goals
- **Efficiency:** Reduce manual effort and paperwork through automation.
- **Clarity:** Provide clear visibility into job statuses, financial data, and staff activities.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure precise tracking of time, materials, and financial figures.
- **Usability:** Intuitive interface for all user roles.
- **Integration:** Potential for integration with external systems (e.g., Xero for accounting, as suggested by `jobs/views/XeroView/`).
