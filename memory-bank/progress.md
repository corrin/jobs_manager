# Progress: Jobs Manager

## What Works
- Initial project analysis and understanding of the Django application structure.
- Memory Bank documentation has been initialized, providing foundational context for the project.

## What's Left to Build (Current Task)
The immediate task is to get the project running locally. This involves:
1.  **Environment Setup:**
    -   Verify Python version.
    -   Install Poetry.
    -   Install project dependencies.
2.  **Database Configuration:**
    -   Create `.env` file.
    -   Configure database settings (initially SQLite).
3.  **Database Migrations:**
    -   Run `python manage.py migrate`.
4.  **Run Development Server:**
    -   Start `python manage.py runserver`.
5.  **Initial Exploration:**
    -   Access the application.
    -   Create a superuser.

## Current Status
- Memory Bank files are created.
- Ready to proceed with environment setup.

## Known Issues
- None identified yet, as the project has not been run. Potential issues may arise during dependency installation or database setup.
