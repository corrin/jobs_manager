# Linked Quote Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding linked quote functionality to the jobs system. The plan breaks down the work into smaller, testable tickets to ensure stability throughout the implementation process.

## Current System Analysis

After examining the codebase, we've identified the following key components:

1. **Job Model Structure**:
   - The Job model is the central entity with fields for job details
   - Each Job has three JobPricing instances (estimate, quote, reality) that track different stages of pricing
   - JobPricing contains time_entries, material_entries, and adjustment_entries
   - The Quote model is linked to a Job and contains information about the quote in Xero

2. **UI Components**:
   - The job edit page has sections for Estimate, Quote, and Reality
   - Each section has tables for time, materials, and adjustments
   - The UI supports both simple and complex (itemized) pricing views

## Proposed Changes

1. **Add Linked Quote Field**: Jobs will have an optional link to a Google Sheets spreadsheet
2. **Google Sheets Integration**: Implement API integration to read/write from Google Sheets
3. **Master Template**: Add a template URL to CompanyDefaults and functionality to duplicate it
4. **Parts Concept**: Restructure job pricing to use parts, where each part contains time entries, material entries, and adjustments
5. **UI Updates**: Make tables readonly when a job has a linked quote and add UI for managing parts

## Implementation Tickets

### Ticket 1: Add Linked Quote Field and Master Template to Company Defaults
**Goal**: Add the basic fields needed for linked quotes without changing functionality.

1. Add `linked_quote` URL field to the Job model
2. Add `master_quote_template_url` field to CompanyDefaults model
3. Create migration for these changes
4. Update the job edit form to display the linked quote field (read-only for now)

**Technical Details**:
- The `linked_quote` field should be a URLField with null=True, blank=True
- The `master_quote_template_url` field should be a URLField with null=True, blank=True
- The migration should be non-destructive and backward compatible

**Now Test**: Verify the application runs normally and the new fields appear in the admin interface but don't affect existing functionality.

### Ticket 2: Google Sheets API Integration Setup
**Goal**: Set up the foundation for Google Sheets integration.

1. Add Google Sheets API client library to the project
2. Create a service for Google Sheets authentication and basic operations
3. Add configuration for Google API credentials
4. Create simple test functions to verify API connectivity

**Technical Details**:
- Use the official Google API Python client library
- Create a new service module in workflow/services/google_sheets_service.py
- Store credentials securely, possibly using environment variables
- Implement basic operations: read spreadsheet, write to spreadsheet, duplicate spreadsheet

**Now Test**: Verify the application can connect to Google Sheets API and perform basic operations like reading a spreadsheet.

### Ticket 3: Master Template Duplication Functionality
**Goal**: Implement the ability to duplicate the master quote template.

1. Add functionality to duplicate the master template spreadsheet
2. Create a service method to generate a new spreadsheet from the template
3. Add a UI button to create a new linked quote from the template
4. Update the job edit form to display the linked quote URL as a clickable link

**Technical Details**:
- Extend the Google Sheets service to support template duplication
- Add a new button to the job edit page near the job details section
- Implement a new API endpoint for creating a linked quote
- Update the job serializer to include the linked_quote field

**Now Test**: Create a new job, click the "Create Linked Quote" button, and verify a new spreadsheet is created and linked to the job.

### Ticket 4: Create Part Model and Database Schema
**Goal**: Introduce the concept of parts without changing the UI yet.

1. Create a new `Part` model with fields for name, description, and job reference
2. Modify JobPricing to reference parts instead of directly containing entries
3. Create migration for these changes with a data migration to create default parts for existing jobs
4. Update the serializers to handle the new structure

**Technical Details**:
- The Part model should include:
  - id (UUID)
  - name (CharField)
  - description (TextField, optional)
  - job_pricing (ForeignKey to JobPricing)
  - created_at, updated_at (DateTimeField)
- The migration should create a default "Other Work" part for each existing JobPricing
- Update JobPricingSerializer to handle the nested parts structure

**Now Test**: Verify existing jobs still display correctly and all functionality works as before.

### Ticket 5: Update UI for Parts in Job Edit Page
**Goal**: Modify the UI to display and manage parts.

1. Update the job edit page to show parts as expandable sections
2. Add UI controls to add/edit/delete parts
3. Ensure the default "Other Work" part is always present
4. Update the grid logic to handle the parts structure

**Technical Details**:
- Modify the edit_job_ajax.html template to support parts
- Update the grid initialization in edit_job_grid_logic.js
- Add new JavaScript functions for managing parts
- Ensure the UI gracefully handles jobs with and without parts

**Now Test**: Create a new job, add multiple parts, and verify they display correctly and can be edited.

### Ticket 6: Implement Readonly Tables for Linked Quotes
**Goal**: Make appropriate tables readonly when a job has a linked quote.

1. Update the UI to detect when a job has a linked quote
2. Make the relevant tables readonly in this case
3. Add visual indicators to show which tables are readonly
4. Add explanatory tooltips

**Technical Details**:
- Add a check in the JavaScript to detect linked quotes
- Modify the grid options to set editable=false when appropriate
- Add CSS classes for visual indication of readonly status
- Add tooltips explaining why tables are readonly

**Now Test**: Create a job with a linked quote and verify the appropriate tables become readonly.

### Ticket 7: Google Sheets Data Synchronization
**Goal**: Implement two-way synchronization between the job and the linked quote spreadsheet.

1. Create service methods to read data from the linked spreadsheet
2. Implement logic to map spreadsheet data to job parts and entries
3. Add functionality to update the spreadsheet when job data changes
4. Add a manual sync button and automatic sync on save

**Technical Details**:
- Define a clear mapping between spreadsheet structure and job data
- Implement bidirectional synchronization in the Google Sheets service
- Add a "Sync with Spreadsheet" button to the job edit page
- Add hooks in the autosave functionality to update the spreadsheet

**Now Test**: Make changes in the job and verify they appear in the spreadsheet; make changes in the spreadsheet and verify they appear in the job.

### Ticket 8: Timesheet Entry Integration with Parts
**Goal**: Ensure timesheet entries work correctly with the new parts structure.

1. Update the timesheet entry UI to select which part the time belongs to

**Technical Details**:
- Modify the TimeEntry model to reference a Part instead of directly referencing JobPricing
- Update the timesheet entry form to include a part selection dropdown
- Modify the timesheet serializer to handle the part reference
- Update the job reality section to group entries by part

**Now Test**: Add timesheet entries to different parts and verify they appear correctly in the job reality section.

### Ticket 9: Stock Addition Integration with Parts
**Goal**: Ensure adding stock to jobs works with the parts structure.

1. Update the "Add Stock" functionality to associate stock with specific parts
2. Modify the stock usage UI to select which part the stock belongs to
3. Update the job reality section to display stock by part

**Technical Details**:
- Modify the MaterialEntry model to reference a Part
- Update the stock usage UI to include a part selection
- Modify the stock usage service to handle part references
- Update the job reality section to display stock items grouped by part

**Now Test**: Add stock to different parts and verify it appears correctly in the job reality section.

### Ticket 10: Final Testing and Documentation
**Goal**: Ensure the entire system works correctly and is well-documented.

1. Create comprehensive documentation for the new features
2. Add tooltips and help text throughout the UI
3. Perform thorough testing of all functionality
4. Fix any remaining issues

**Technical Details**:
- Update user documentation with instructions for linked quotes and parts

- Create test cases covering all aspects of the new functionality
- Perform end-to-end testing of the entire job lifecycle

**Now Test**: Perform end-to-end testing of the entire job lifecycle with linked quotes and parts.

### Ticket 11: Shift to remove the old Gemini API Key

We need to use Service accounts as screated in the earlier steps.


genai.configure(credentials=creds)

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25")
response = model.generate_content("Summarise: 5 tips for running a good stand-up meeting.")

print(response.text)


## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Data Migration Complexity**:
   - Risk: Migrating existing jobs to the new parts structure could be complex
   - Mitigation: Create a thorough data migration plan and test extensively with production data copies

2. **Google Sheets API Limitations**:
   - Risk: API rate limits or performance issues
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, batch operations, and error handling

3. **UI Complexity**:
   - Risk: The UI could become too complex with the addition of parts
   - Mitigation: Focus on usability, add clear documentation, and gather user feedback early

4. **Synchronization Conflicts**:
   - Risk: Conflicts between spreadsheet changes and job changes
   - Mitigation: Implement conflict detection and resolution strategies

## Conclusion

This implementation plan breaks down the linked quote feature into manageable tickets that can be implemented and tested incrementally. Each ticket builds on the previous one, ensuring that the system remains stable throughout the implementation process.

By following this plan, we can successfully implement the linked quote feature while minimizing disruption to existing functionality and ensuring a smooth transition for users.
