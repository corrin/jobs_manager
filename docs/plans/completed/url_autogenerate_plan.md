# URL Documentation Auto-Generation - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Work Completed (2025-07-02)

All critical issues have been resolved:

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed `_wrapped_view` Issue
**COMPLETED**: MCP endpoints now show actual function names instead of `_wrapped_view`
- Added decorator unwrapping logic to handle `service_api_key_required` and other decorators
- MCP endpoints now properly display: `views.search_stock_api`, `views.job_context_api`, etc.

### ‚úÖ 2. Fixed Pattern Extraction Errors
**COMPLETED**: Zero pattern extraction errors remain
- Added proper type checking for string vs object patterns
- Handle both `_route` and `_regex` pattern types
- Added fallback handling for edge cases

### ‚úÖ 3. Improved Categorization Logic
**COMPLETED**: Zero categorization warnings remain
- Django admin URLs properly categorized under "Django Admin"
- Generic patterns like `//` handled appropriately
- All URLs now have proper categories

### ‚úÖ 4. Verified All URLs Captured
**COMPLETED**: All URLs from Django's URL resolver are captured in documentation
- No URLs are skipped due to processing failures
- Generic admin patterns included under "Other" or "Django Admin"
- Complete coverage achieved

### üìù 5. Remaining Documentation Quality
**STATUS**: 85 URLs still need docstrings, but these are mostly:
- Django admin views (don't need custom docstrings)
- Application views that need developer attention

**Key application views needing docstrings**:
- `xero_view.XeroErrorListAPIView` / `XeroErrorDetailAPIView`
- `company_defaults_api.CompanyDefaultsAPIView`
- `edit_job_view_ajax.autosave_job_view`
- `edit_job_view_ajax.create_job_api`
- Various job management and staff management endpoints

## Final Status: SUCCESS ‚úÖ

All critical script issues resolved. The URL documentation generator now:
- ‚úÖ Captures ALL URLs without exceptions
- ‚úÖ Properly unwraps decorated views
- ‚úÖ Handles all pattern types without errors
- ‚úÖ Categorizes URLs appropriately
- ‚úÖ Provides comprehensive documentation

The remaining work is adding docstrings to specific view functions, which is ongoing development work, not a script issue.
