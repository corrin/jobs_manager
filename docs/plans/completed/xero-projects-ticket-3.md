# Xero Projects Ticket 3: Xero Projects API Integration

## Overview

Adding Projects API calls to the existing Xero API infrastructure to support project creation, updates, and time/expense entry management.

## Progress

### ‚úÖ Created progress document

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Task 2: Add Projects API calls to apps/workflow/api/xero/xero.py

- ‚úÖ Added ProjectsApi import
- ‚úÖ Added get_projects method to retrieve projects from Xero
- ‚úÖ Added create_project method to create new projects in Xero
- ‚úÖ Added update_project method to update existing projects
- ‚úÖ Follow existing API patterns in the file

#### Task 3: Implement get_projects, create_project, update_project functions

- ‚úÖ get_projects: Retrieve all projects or filter by specific criteria
- ‚úÖ create_project: Create project with contact, name, deadline, estimate
- ‚úÖ update_project: Update project details and status

#### Task 4: Implement bulk time/expense entry operations

- ‚úÖ create_time_entries: Bulk create time entries for a project
- ‚úÖ create_expense_entries: Bulk create expense entries for a project
- ‚úÖ update_time_entries: Bulk update existing time entries
- ‚úÖ update_expense_entries: Bulk update existing expense entries

### üîÑ Tasks In Progress

#### Task 5: Test with Xero sandbox - BLOCKED

- ‚ùå Ensure API calls work correctly with Xero sandbox environment - BLOCKED: missing "projects" scope in token
- Note we are connected to a special safe Xero Demo Company so it should sync all our jobs into projects
- ‚ùå Test error handling and edge cases - BLOCKED: cannot test without proper token scope

**CRITICAL: Cannot test API calls until Xero token is re-authenticated with "projects" scope**

#### Task 6: Run MyPy on edited files

- ‚úÖ Fixed import issues (changed from xero_python.projects to xero_python.project)
- ‚úÖ Fixed ProjectsApi to ProjectApi across all function calls
- ‚úÖ Added proper type annotations to new functions
- ‚úÖ Fixed function parameter type annotations for pretty_print and exchange_code_for_token
- ‚úÖ Remaining MyPy errors are from existing third-party API calls returning Any (not fixable without type stubs)

## Implementation Notes

- Following existing patterns in apps/workflow/api/xero/xero.py
- Using Xero Projects API scope (projects)
- Implementing proper error handling with persist_app_error
- Maintaining consistency with existing API call patterns
- Rate limiting considerations (60 calls/minute, 5000 calls/day)
