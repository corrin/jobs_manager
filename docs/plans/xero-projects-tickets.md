# Xero Projects Implementation Tickets

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR CLAUDE CODE

**NEVER mark tickets as DONE (‚úÖ) unless ALL sub-tasks are actually completed and working.**

**Use these status indicators:**
- ‚úÖ = Fully completed and tested
- ‚ùå = Not done, blocked, or failed
- üîÑ = In progress
- ‚è∏Ô∏è = Paused/waiting

**Always be accurate about what has actually been accomplished vs what has only been partially implemented.**

## Foundation

### Ticket 1: Model Changes ‚úÖ DONE
- ‚úÖ Add Xero sync fields to Job model (`xero_project_id`, `xero_last_synced`, `xero_last_modified`)
- ‚úÖ Add `xero_user_id` field to Staff model
- ‚úÖ Add Xero sync fields to CostLine model (`xero_time_id`, `xero_expense_id`, sync timestamps)
- ‚úÖ Create and run migrations

### Ticket 2: Invoice Model Refactoring
- Change Invoice.job from OneToOneField to ForeignKey
- Remove Job `invoiced` property, add `fully_invoiced` BooleanField
- Update all code using `job.invoice` to use `job.invoices` pattern
- Update all code using `job.invoiced` to use `job.fully_invoiced`
- Create and run migrations with data population
- in particular, set fully_invoiced to true for all jobs that have an invoice

## Push Sync (Our System ‚Üí Xero) - PRIORITY

### Ticket 3: Xero Projects API Integration ‚úÖ DONE
- Add Projects API calls to `apps/workflow/api/xero/xero.py`
- Implement `get_projects`, `create_project`, `update_project`
- Implement bulk time/expense entry operations
- Test with Xero sandbox

### Ticket 4: Job to Xero Push Function üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- ‚úÖ Create `sync_job_to_xero(job)` function in sync.py
- ‚úÖ Map Job fields to Xero project data (including status mapping)
- ‚úÖ Handle estimate mapping from `latest_estimate`
- ‚úÖ Single API call per job - projects scope is working
- ‚ùå Map `kind='time'` ‚Üí time entries, all others ‚Üí expenses - TODO (CostLine sync)
- ‚ùå Track synced CostLines with Xero IDs - TODO (CostLine sync)
- ‚úÖ Add comprehensive error handling

**STATUS: Core job sync complete. CostLine sync must be finished before moving to Ticket 5.**

### Ticket 5: Initial Job Sync & Triggers
- Create management command to sync ALL existing jobs to Xero
- Add sync trigger on job save (edit button)
- Add sync trigger on archive status change
- Add "Sync Now" UI button
- Integrate with hourly scheduled sync
- Batch processing for API rate limits
- Handle all job types including shop jobs

### Ticket 6: Validation & Monitoring
- Validate every job exists as Xero project
- Add sync status tracking to Job model
- Error reporting and retry mechanisms
- Management command to verify sync integrity

## Pull Sync (Xero ‚Üí Our System) - LATER

### Ticket 7: Projects Transform Function

- Map Xero project fields to Job fields (including status mapping)
- Handle estimate mapping from `latest_estimate`
- Add error handling

### Ticket 8: Projects ENTITY_CONFIG
- Add projects to `ENTITY_CONFIGS` in sync.py
- Test projects sync in scheduled sync process

## Bidirectional Sync

### Ticket 8: CostLine to Xero Sync

- Handle staff mapping via `xero_user_id`
- Bulk operations to minimize API calls
- Track sync status on CostLines

### Ticket 9: Xero to CostLine Creation
- Create CostLines from new Xero time/expense entries
- Map Xero time entries ‚Üí time CostLines
- Map Xero expenses ‚Üí material/adjust CostLines
- Handle staff mapping and prevent duplicates

## Migration & Deployment

- Management command to sync all existing jobs
- Batch processing for API rate limits
- Handle all job types including shop jobs

### Ticket 11: Testing
