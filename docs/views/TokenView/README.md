### CustomTokenObtainPairView
**File**: `apps/accounts/views/token_view.py`
**Type**: Class-based view (TokenObtainPairView)
**URL**: `/accounts/api/token/`

#### What it does
- Provides JWT token authentication with enhanced security features
- Handles password reset requirement enforcement
- Sets JWT tokens as secure httpOnly cookies when enabled
- Validates user credentials and generates access/refresh token pairs
- Supports both API token authentication and cookie-based authentication

#### Parameters
- JSON body with authentication credentials:
  - `username`: User email address (required)
  - `password`: User password (required)

#### Returns
- **200 OK**: JSON with JWT tokens and user authentication data
  - `access`: JWT access token (or set as httpOnly cookie)
  - `refresh`: JWT refresh token (or set as httpOnly cookie)
  - `password_needs_reset`: Boolean flag for forced password reset
  - `password_reset_url`: URL for password change if reset required
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid credentials or authentication failure
- **400 Bad Request**: Malformed request or missing required fields

#### Integration
- CustomTokenObtainPairSerializer for enhanced credential validation
- JWT configuration from Django settings
- Password reset enforcement workflow
- httpOnly cookie security when ENABLE_JWT_AUTH is configured
- User model integration for account status checking

### CustomTokenRefreshView
**File**: `apps/accounts/views/token_view.py`
**Type**: Class-based view (TokenRefreshView)
**URL**: `/accounts/api/token/refresh/`

#### What it does
- Refreshes JWT access tokens using valid refresh tokens
- Supports both cookie-based and request body refresh tokens
- Provides seamless token renewal for continuous authentication
- Maintains httpOnly cookie security for token storage
- Handles token lifecycle management

#### Parameters
- **Option 1**: JSON body with refresh token:
  - `refresh`: Valid JWT refresh token (required)
- **Option 2**: httpOnly cookie containing refresh token
  - Automatically extracted from `refresh_token` cookie

#### Returns
- **200 OK**: JSON with new access token
  - `access`: New JWT access token (or set as httpOnly cookie)
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or expired refresh token
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing refresh token or malformed request

#### Integration
- JWT settings configuration for token lifetime and security
- httpOnly cookie handling for secure token storage
- Automatic token extraction from cookies or request body
- Access token renewal workflow

### post (CustomTokenRefreshView)
**File**: `apps/accounts/views/token_view.py`
**Type**: Method override within CustomTokenRefreshView

#### What it does
- Overrides default token refresh with cookie support
- Handles refresh token extraction from multiple sources
- Manages access token renewal with security features
- Provides seamless token refresh experience

#### Parameters
- Enhanced refresh token handling from cookies or request body
- Automatic token source detection

#### Returns
- Refreshed access token with security features
- httpOnly cookie management for token storage

#### Integration
- Cookie-based token storage and retrieval
- JWT settings integration for security configuration
- Token lifecycle management

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing credentials, malformed requests, or invalid token format
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid credentials, expired tokens, or authentication failures
- **404 Not Found**: User account not found during authentication
- **500 Internal Server Error**: System failures or configuration errors
- Comprehensive logging for debugging authentication issues
- Security-focused error messages to prevent information leakage

## Security Features
- **httpOnly Cookies**: Secure token storage preventing XSS attacks
- **Secure Cookie Flags**: HTTPS-only transmission for production security
- **SameSite Protection**: CSRF protection through cookie configuration
- **Password Reset Enforcement**: Required password changes for security compliance
- **Token Lifetime Management**: Configurable token expiration for security
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive authentication event tracking

## Integration Points
- **JWT Configuration**: Django settings for token security and lifetime
- **User Model**: Staff account integration for authentication
- **Password Management**: Password reset workflow integration
- **Cookie Security**: httpOnly and secure cookie configuration
- **API Authentication**: Token-based API access control

## Business Rules
- Username field maps to user email address for authentication
- Password reset requirement blocks normal authentication flow
- JWT tokens can be stored as httpOnly cookies or returned in response body
- Token refresh requires valid refresh token from cookie or request body
- Authentication events are logged for security monitoring

## Configuration Options
- `ENABLE_JWT_AUTH`: Enable httpOnly cookie-based token storage
- `SIMPLE_JWT`: JWT token configuration including lifetime and security settings
- `COOKIE_SAMESITE`: Environment-based SameSite cookie configuration
- Token lifetime configuration for access and refresh tokens
- Cookie domain and security flag configuration

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient JWT token generation and validation
- Optimized cookie handling and configuration
- Minimal database queries for user authentication
- Cached JWT settings for quick access
- Efficient token refresh workflow
