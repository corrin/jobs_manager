### logout_user
**File**: `apps/accounts/views/user_profile_view.py`
**Type**: Function-based API view (POST only)
**URL**: `/accounts/logout/`

#### What it does
- Provides secure logout functionality with JWT token cleanup

- httpOnly cookie management for secure token cleanup
- Response cookie deletion with proper domain and SameSite settings
- Authentication system integration for session termination

## Error Handling
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required for profile access
- **500 Internal Server Error**: System failures during profile retrieval or logout
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging authentication issues
- User-friendly error messages for API consumers
- Graceful handling of token cleanup failures

## Security Features
- **Authentication Required**: Profile access requires valid JWT authentication
- **httpOnly Cookie Cleanup**: Secure removal of authentication tokens
- **Domain-Specific Cookie Deletion**: Proper cookie cleanup across domains
- **SameSite Cookie Handling**: CSRF protection during logout
- **Error Message Security**: Non-revealing error messages to prevent information leakage

## Data Serialization
- UserProfileSerializer provides comprehensive user profile structure
- Read-only profile data to prevent unauthorized modifications
- Computed fields like fullName for UI convenience
- Request context integration for personalized responses

## Integration Points
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication via cookies or headers
- **Staff Model**: User account data and profile information
- **Authentication Middleware**: Session management and user context
- **Frontend Applications**: Profile data for UI personalization

## Business Rules
- Only authenticated users can access their profile information
- Profile data is read-only via this endpoint
- Logout clears all authentication tokens for security
- User identity is derived from authenticated session context
- Profile access supports both cookie and header-based authentication

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient user profile serialization
- Minimal database queries for profile data
- Optimized cookie cleanup operations
- Cached JWT settings for quick access
- Single-query user profile retrieval

## Security Considerations
- Authentication required for all operations
- Secure token cleanup during logout
- httpOnly cookie handling prevents XSS attacks
- Proper cookie domain and SameSite configuration
- Error handling prevents information disclosure
