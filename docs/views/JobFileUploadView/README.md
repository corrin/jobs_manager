- Relative path calculation for Dropbox integration

## File Management
- **Dropbox Integration**: Files stored in `DROPBOX_WORKFLOW_FOLDER/Job-{job_number}/`
- **Folder Creation**: Automatic job-specific folder creation with proper permissions
- **File Permissions**: 0o664 for uploaded files, 0o2775 for folders
- **Duplicate Handling**: update_or_create pattern prevents duplicate JobFile records
- **Metadata Storage**: MIME type, filename, and path information preserved

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing job_number or no files uploaded
- **404 Not Found**: Job not found for specified job number
- **500 Internal Server Error**: File system errors or database failures
- Comprehensive error messages for troubleshooting

## Business Rules
- Files are organized by job number in Dropbox folders
- Multiple files can be uploaded in a single request
- Existing files are updated rather than duplicated
- All uploaded files default to not printing on job sheets
- Files are marked as "active" status upon upload
- Job must exist before files can be attached

## Integration Points
- **JobNumberLookupMixin**: Job validation and error handling
- **Dropbox Integration**: File storage and synchronization
- **JobFile Model**: Metadata persistence and relationship management
- **JobFileSerializer**: Response data formatting and API consistency
- **Settings Configuration**: Dropbox folder path configuration

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient file chunking for large file uploads
- Batch processing of multiple files in single request
- Optimized folder creation with exist_ok parameter
- update_or_create pattern prevents duplicate database queries
- Relative path calculation for storage efficiency

## Security Considerations
- Job number validation prevents unauthorized file association
- File permission management for secure access
- MIME type validation and storage
- Folder permission settings for multi-user access
- Input validation for file and job parameters

## File Storage Structure
```
DROPBOX_WORKFLOW_FOLDER/
├── Job-{job_number}/
