### validate_mapping
**File**: `apps/purchasing/views/product_mapping.py`
**Type**: Function-based view (POST only)
**URL**: `/purchasing/api/product-mapping/<uuid:mapping_id>/validate/`

#### What it does
- Validates and updates specific product parsing mappings
- Handles manual corrections to AI-parsed product data
- Updates validation status with user and timestamp tracking
- Propagates validated data to related supplier products
- Manages Xero integration status for validated mappings

#### Parameters
- `mapping_id`: UUID of mapping to validate (path parameter)
- Form data with validation updates:
  - `mapped_item_code`: Corrected item code
  - `mapped_description`: Corrected product description
  - `mapped_metal_type`: Corrected material type
  - `mapped_alloy`: Corrected alloy specification
  - `mapped_specifics`: Corrected specific details
  - `mapped_dimensions`: Corrected dimensional data
  - `mapped_unit_cost`: Corrected unit pricing
  - `mapped_price_unit`: Corrected pricing unit
  - `validation_notes`: User notes about validation

#### Returns
- **200 OK**: JSON success response with update confirmation
  - `success`: True
  - `message`: Validation confirmation with update count
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid unit cost format or validation errors
- **404 Not Found**: Mapping not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: System failures during validation

#### Integration
- ProductParsingMapping model for validation updates
- SupplierProduct model for data propagation
- User tracking for validation accountability
- Xero status integration for accounting system sync

## Validation Features
- **AI Correction**: Manual correction of automated parsing results
- **Data Propagation**: Validated mappings update related supplier products
- **Progress Tracking**: Statistics on validation completion rates
- **Quality Control**: User validation with notes and timestamps
- **Xero Integration**: Mapping validation affects accounting system status

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid unit cost format or malformed data
- **404 Not Found**: Mapping not found for validation
- **500 Internal Server Error**: System failures or database errors
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and audit trails
- User-friendly error messages for validation workflow

## Business Rules
- Unvalidated mappings are prioritized for review
- User validation creates audit trail with timestamps
- Validated data propagates to all related supplier products
- Mapping validation affects Xero integration status
- Unit cost validation ensures proper decimal formatting
- Validation notes support quality control documentation

## Integration Points
- **ProductParsingMapping Model**: Core mapping data for validation
- **SupplierProduct Model**: Related products for data propagation
- **User Model**: Validation accountability and tracking
- **Xero Integration**: Status updates for accounting system
