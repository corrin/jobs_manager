## Business Rules and Constraints

### Month-End Processing
- Jobs must be in appropriate status for month-end processing
- Pricing revisions must be properly archived
- Historical data integrity must be maintained
- Accounting period consistency validation

### Event Management
- Events must have valid descriptions and classifications
- User attribution required for all manual events
- Event timestamps must be accurate and consistent
- Audit trail completeness enforcement

### Complexity Management
- Complex job features require appropriate user permissions
- Complexity changes must validate existing job data
- Feature availability controlled by complexity status
- Business rules enforcement for complex workflows

### Job Deletion
- Jobs with active invoices cannot be deleted
- Jobs with purchase orders require special handling
- Time entries and costs must be properly handled
- Client relationships preserved during deletion

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Business rule violations, validation errors, or invalid job states
- **401 Unauthorized**: Insufficient permissions for management operations
- **404 Not Found**: Job or related resources not found
